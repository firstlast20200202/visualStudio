tool -> options -> Environment -> General -> Color Theme : change visual studio theme

tool -> options -> Environment -> Fonts and Colors / show setting for -> Text Editor : change code font and size
tool -> options -> Environment -> Fonts and Colors / show setting for -> Output Window : change code font and size
Debug -> Start without debugging : start executing the code
tool -> options -> Text Editor -> All Languages -> Line numbers : enable line numbers in the code
tool -> options -> Import and Export Settings -> Reset all settings : reset all the settings in case accidently changed them

How to debug:
1. start without debugging -> no
2. it'll show in Error List and Output these two tabs at the bottom of vs
3. in Error List, abc means the errors made while writing, X means the errors made in compiling
4. errors made while writing should be fixed first, just double click the error, it'll focus to the line
5. hover on the red underline in the code, it'll show the error
6. to change the font of the hovered error: tool -> options -> Editor Tooltip
7. once the errors made in writing have been fixed, they'll auto-disapear in the error list, better to start without debugging again
8. it shows errors made in compiling, sometimes can get more information in Output tab

shotcut keys of creating another source file: shift + (fn) + F2

to show code structure: View -> Solution Explorer

in Solution Explorer, right click the project name, click Open Folder in Files Explorer, it'll show all the files of the project
in Solution Explorer, right click one source file, then click remove, it'll remove the file from the file list; if click Open Folder in Files Explorer, 
it still shows up in the folder; right click SourceFiles -> Add -> Existing Item, double click the file, it'll come back
in Solution Explorer, right click one source file, then click delete, it'll move the file to recycle bin in your computer; if click Open Folder in 
Files Explorer, it doesnt show up in the folder anymore

for exe files, there are 4 versions:
debug x64: if send itself to other people, it probably cant be opened since it's depandent on other files in the project
release x64: if send itself to other prople, it can be opened
debug x86: for old systems
release x86: for old systems

can check type of your vs in Help -> About Microsoft vs: it shows up x64 or x86
can check type of your computer in Start -> System -> System Type: it shows up x64 or x86

to generate x86 debug version and release version: Build -> Build Solution -> Build [projectName], it'll generate two folders 'Debug' and 'Release' 
which are parallel to 'x64' in the project folder

to send code to people, gotta close vs then compress the project folder

align code: ctrl + A, then keep ctrl pressed: K and F
