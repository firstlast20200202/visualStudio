3. in Error List, abc means the errors made while writing, X means the errors made in compiling
4. errors made while writing should be fixed first, just double click the error, it'll focus to the line
5. hover on the red underline in the code, it'll show the error
6. to change the font of the hovered error: tool -> options -> Editor Tooltip
